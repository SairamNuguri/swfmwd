# SWFWMD Permitting Demo

A simple Spring Boot application that demonstrates a basic permit application form for the **Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD)**. The application collects a userâ€™s name, address, county, and permit type, then stores the permit data in a MySQL database. It also provides a placeholder method for calling the USPS web API to validate the address.
